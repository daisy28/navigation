            <h2>Rose Pink and Purple Combo</h2>
            <p>Rose Pink is an attractive companion to this confident shade of purple. 
                Pink and purple are close together on the color wheel and this commonality 
                ensures that they are two colors that go together well.
                They are both darker shades of their respective colors 
                and this changes how they are perceived. Purple and pink in this instance could be 
                seen as signifiers of creativity and wisdom.</p>
